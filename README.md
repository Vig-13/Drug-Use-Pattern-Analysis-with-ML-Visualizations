# Drug Use Pattern Analysis with ML & Visualizations

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of drug usage patterns using demographic and personality-related features. It leverages data visualization, correlation studies, and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns in drug use across various age groups and personality traits.

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset contains information on users' consumption of 19 types of drugs, along with features like:

- Age, Gender, Country, Ethnicity
- Personality traits: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness
- Impulsiveness, Sensation-seeking

## 📊 Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Removed missing values and standardized column formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
  - Age distribution of drug users
  - Drug usage by personality traits
  - Correlation heatmaps to understand inter-feature relationships
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset is originally from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## 📈 Results

- Visual insights into how age and traits like sensation-seeking influence drug use
- Achieved classification accuracy for certain drug usage predictions
- Identified which personality traits correlate with higher drug usage

## 🧠 Potential Use Cases

- Public health awareness
- Mental health research
- Sociological pattern detection
